# Java_final
Final Java project.  A GUI program which collects and displays information (specifically Winter Olympics results)

The program creates an object representing a specific Winter Olympics which stores a list of Event Objects which in turn store a list of Participant objects.  The main GUI allows for a new Olympics object to be created, or one to be created/loaded to/from a file, as well as the ability to add events from a text file.  Additionally a new GUI can be opened which allows the manual creation of events to be added to the active Olympics object.
